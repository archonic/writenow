# Tiptap + Prosemirror + Rails Experiment

This is a PoC to bring Tiptap editor into a Rails app. It has a few RubyUI Editor components which work with a Editor stimulus controller. Fully local simultaneous editing is supported. :tada:.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have the right Ruby and Node versions installed (check .ruby-version and .node-version)
2. Run `bin/setup`. This does the usual Rails setup but it also installs Hocuspocus dependencies.
3. Run `bin/dev`

Production and test stuff has been ignored for this PoC.
